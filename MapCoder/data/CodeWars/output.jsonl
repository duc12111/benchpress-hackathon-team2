{"problem_id": 3658, "question": "The response shall be at maximum of 5000 tokens. Your job is to change the given string `s` using a non-negative integer `n`.\n\nEach bit in `n` will specify whether or not to swap the case for each alphabetic character in `s`: if the bit is `1`, swap the case; if its `0`, leave it as is. When you finished with the last bit of `n`, start again with the first bit.\n\nYou should skip the checking of bits when a non-alphabetic character is encountered, but they should be preserved in their original positions.\n\n## Examples\n\n```\nswap('Hello world!', 11)  -->  'heLLO wORLd!'\n```\n...because `11` is `1011` in binary, so the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th and 9th alphabetical characters have to be swapped:\n```\nH e l l o  w o r l d !\n1 0 1 1 1  0 1 1 1 0\n^   ^ ^ ^    ^ ^ ^\n```\n\nMore examples:\n```\nswap(\"gOOd MOrniNg\", 7864)  -->  \"GooD MorNIng\"\nswap('', 11345)  -->  ''\nswap('the lord of the rings', 0)  -->  'the lord of the rings'\n```", "input_output": {"fn_name": "swap", "inputs": [["Hello world!", 11], ["the quick broWn fox leapt over the fence", 9], ["eVerybody likes ice cReam", 85], ["gOOd MOrniNg", 7864], ["how are you today?", 12345], ["the lord of the rings", 0], ["", 11345]], "outputs": [["heLLO wORLd!"], ["The QUicK BrowN foX LeaPT ovER thE FenCE"], ["EVErYbODy LiKeS IcE creAM"], ["GooD MorNIng"], ["HOw are yoU TOdaY?"], ["the lord of the rings"], [""]]}, "url": "https://www.codewars.com/kata/5f3afc40b24f090028233490", "difficulty": "introductory", "starter_code": "def swap(s,n):\n\t"}
